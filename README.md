# Campaign Dashboard

A simple campaign dashboard built using React and Ant Design.

## Overview

The goal of the project was to create a frontend for a campaign dashboard that allows users to:

- view campaigns
- create a new campaign
- edit an existing campaign
- amend the status of a campaign between active and deleted
- filter campaigns by name, type, start date or end date
- sort campaigns by name, type, start date, end date or status

Using no backend, all data is stored in the user's local storage.

## Deployment

This application is deployed using Netlify and can be accessed [here](https://trbo-campaign-dashboard.netlify.app/).
